</div><div class='output co'>#&gt;                  Changes in version 2.5-52 (2020-10-17)                 
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the metafor package now makes use of the mathjaxr package to nicely
#&gt;     render equations shown in the HTML help pages
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added selmodel() for fitting a wide variety of selection models (and
#&gt;     added the corresponding plot.rma.uni.selmodel() function for drawing
#&gt;     the estimated selection function)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added tes() function for the test of excess significance
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added rcalc(), matreg(), dfround(), and vec2mat() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various cumul() functions provide I^2 and H^2 also for
#&gt;     fixed-effects models; accordingly, plot.cumul.rma() now also works
#&gt;     with such models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - simulate.rma() gains yilim argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added weighted argument to fsn() (for Orwin's method)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added some more transformation functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - bldiag() now properly handles ?x0 or 0x? matrices
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - p-values are still given to 2 digits when digits = 1
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - summary.escalc() also provides the p-values (of the Wald-type
#&gt;     tests); but when using the transf argument, the sampling variances,
#&gt;     standard errors, test statistics, and p-values are no longer shown
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() no longer constrains a fixed tau2 value to 0 when k=1
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - started using the pbapply package for showing progress bars, also
#&gt;     when using parallel processing
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - to avoid potential confusion, all references to 'credibility
#&gt;     intervals' have been removed from the documentation; these intervals
#&gt;     are now exclusively referred to as 'prediction intervals'; in the
#&gt;     output, the bounds are therefore indicated now as pi.lb and pi.ub
#&gt;     (instead of cr.lb and cr.ub); the corresponding argument names were
#&gt;     changed in addpoly.default(); argument addcred was changed to
#&gt;     addpred in addpoly.rma() and forest.rma(); however, code using the
#&gt;     old arguments names should continue to work
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - vif() gains btt argument and can now also compute generalized
#&gt;     variance inflation factors; a proper print.vif.rma() function was
#&gt;     added
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in the various forest() functions, the right header is now
#&gt;     suppressed when annotate=FALSE and header=TRUE
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the forest and funnel arguments of reporter.rma.uni() can now also
#&gt;     be logicals to suppress the drawing of these plots
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - one can now use weights(..., type="rowsum") for intercept-only
#&gt;     rma.mv models (to obtain 'row-sum weights')
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.rma() gains colout argument (to adjust the color of the
#&gt;     observed effect sizes or outcomes)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight speedup in functions that repeatedly fit rma.uni() models by
#&gt;     skipping the computation of the pseudo R^2 statistic
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.default() and funnel.rma() gain label and offset arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.default() and funnel.rma() gain lty argument; the reference
#&gt;     line is now drawn by default as a dotted line (like the line for the
#&gt;     pseudo confidence region)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - regtest() now shows the 'limit estimate' of the (average) true
#&gt;     effect when using sei, vi, ninv, or sqrtninv as predictor (and the
#&gt;     model does not contain any other moderators)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - show nicer network graphs for dat.hasselblad1998 and dat.senn2013 in
#&gt;     the help files
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - refactored various functions (for cleaner/simpler code)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added 12 new datasets (dat.anand1999, dat.baskerville2012,
#&gt;     dat.cannon2006, dat.cohen1981, dat.craft2003, dat.damico2009,
#&gt;     dat.dorn2007, dat.hahn2001, dat.kalaian1996, dat.kearon1998,
#&gt;     dat.lau1992, dat.vanhowe1999)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed level not getting passed down to the various cumul() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - improved the documentation a bit
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 2.4-0 (2020-03-19)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - version jump to 2.4-0 for CRAN release (from now on, even minor
#&gt;     numbers for CRAN releases, odd numbers for development versions)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions gain header argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() gains include argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - setting verbose=3 in model fitting functions sets options(warn=1)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.rma() and forest.default() now throw informative errors when
#&gt;     misusing order and subset arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed failing tests due to the stringsAsFactors=FALSE change in the
#&gt;     upcoming version of R
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - print.infl.rma.uni() gains infonly argument, to only show the
#&gt;     influential studies
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - removed MASS from Suggests (no longer needed)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument btt can now also take a string to grep for
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added optimParallel as possible optimizer in rma.mv()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added (for now undocumented) option to fit models in rma.glmm() via
#&gt;     the GLMMadaptive package (instead of lme4); to try this, use:
#&gt;     control=list(package="GLMMadaptive")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - started to use numbering scheme for devel version (the number after
#&gt;     the dash indicates the devel version)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added contrmat() function (for creating a matrix that indicates
#&gt;     which groups have been compared against each other in each row of a
#&gt;     dataset)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added to.wide() function (for restructuring long format datasets
#&gt;     into the wide format needed for contrast-based analyses)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - I^2 and H^2 are also shown in output for fixed-effects models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument grid in baujat() can now also be a color name
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added (for now undocumented) time argument to more functions that
#&gt;     are computationally expensive
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added (for now undocumented) textpos argument to the various forest
#&gt;     functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.graves2010)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added more tests
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 2.1-0 (2019-05-13)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added formula() method for objects of class rma
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - llplot() now also allows for measure="GEN"; also, the documentation
#&gt;     and y-axis label have been corrected to indicate that the function
#&gt;     plots likelihoods (not log likelihoods)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - confint.rma.mv() now returns an object of class list.confint.rma
#&gt;     when obtaining CIs for all variance and correlation components of
#&gt;     the model; added corresponding print.list.confint.rma() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - moved tol argument in permutest() to control and renamed to comptol
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added PMM and GENQM estimators in rma.uni()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added vif() function to get variance inflation factors
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added .glmulti object for making the interaction with glmulti easier
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added reporter() and reporter.rma.uni() for dynamically generating
#&gt;     analysis reports for objects of class rma.uni
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - output is now styled/colored when crayon package is loaded (this
#&gt;     only works on a 'proper' terminal with color support; also works in
#&gt;     RStudio)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - overhauled plot.gosh.rma(); when out is specified, it now shows two
#&gt;     distributions, one for the values when the outlier is included and
#&gt;     one for the values when for outlier is excluded; dropped the hcol
#&gt;     argument and added border argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - refactored influence.rma.uni() to be more consistent internally with
#&gt;     other functions; print.infl.rma.uni() and plot.infl.rma.uni()
#&gt;     adjusted accordingly; functions cooks.distance.rma.uni(),
#&gt;     dfbetas.rma.uni(), and rstudent.rma.uni() now call
#&gt;     influence.rma.uni() for the computations
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rstudent.rma.uni() now computes the SE of the deleted residuals in
#&gt;     such a way that it will yield identical results to a mean shift
#&gt;     outlier model even when that model is fitted with test="knha"
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rstandard.rma.uni() gains type argument, and can now also compute
#&gt;     conditional residuals (it still computes marginal residuals by
#&gt;     default)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance.rma.mv() gains cluster argument, so that the Cook's
#&gt;     distances can be computed for groups of estimates
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance.rma.mv() gains parallel, ncpus, and cl arguments and
#&gt;     can now make use of parallel processing
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance.rma.mv() should be faster by using the estimates from
#&gt;     the full model as starting values when fitting the models with the
#&gt;     ith study/cluster deleted from the dataset
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance.rma.mv() gains reestimate argument; when set to
#&gt;     FALSE, variance/correlation components are not reestimated
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rstandard.rma.mv() gains cluster argument for computing
#&gt;     cluster-level multivariate standardized residuals
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added rstudent.rma.mv() and dfbetas.rma.mv()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - smarter matching of elements in newmods (when using a named vector)
#&gt;     in predict() that also works for models with interactions (thanks to
#&gt;     Nicole Erler for pointing out the problem)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() and rma.mv() no longer issue (obvious) warnings when user
#&gt;     constrains vi or V to 0 (i.e., vi=0 or V=0, respectively)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() does more intelligent filtering based on NAs in V matrix
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now ensures strict symmetry of any (var-cov or correlation)
#&gt;     matrices specified via the R argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed rma.mv() so checks on R argument run as intended; also fixed
#&gt;     an issue when multiple formulas with slashes are specified via
#&gt;     random (thanks to Andrew Loignon for pointing out the problem)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - suppressed showing calls on some warnings/errors in rma.mv()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now allows for a continuous-time autoregressive random
#&gt;     effects structure (struct="CAR") and various spatial correlation
#&gt;     structures (struct="SPEXP", "SPGAU", "SPLIN", "SPRAT", and "SPSPH")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now allows for struct="GEN" which models correlated random
#&gt;     effects for any number of predictors, including continuous ones
#&gt;     (i.e., this allows for 'random slopes')
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in the various forest() functions, when options(na.action="na.pass")
#&gt;     or options(na.action="na.exclude") and an annotation contains NA,
#&gt;     this is now shown as a blank (instead of NA [NA, NA])
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() and addpoly() functions gain a fonts argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions gain a top argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions now show correct point sizes when the
#&gt;     weights of the studies are exactly the same
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.cumul.rma() gains a col argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.default() and funnel.rma() can now take vectors as input for
#&gt;     the col and bg arguments (and also for pch); both functions also
#&gt;     gain a legend argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - addpoly() functions can now also show prediction interval bounds
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - removed 'formula interface' from escalc(); until this actually adds
#&gt;     some kind of extra functionality, this just makes escalc() more
#&gt;     confusing to use
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now compute the coefficient of variation ratio and the
#&gt;     variability ratio for pre-post or matched designs ("CVRC", "VRC")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() does a bit more housekeeping
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added (currently undocumented) arguments onlyo1, addyi, and addvi to
#&gt;     escalc() that allow for more flexibility when computing certain bias
#&gt;     corrections and when computing sampling variances for measures that
#&gt;     make use of the add and to arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() now sets add=0 for measures where the use of such a bias
#&gt;     correction makes little sense; this applies to the following
#&gt;     measures: "AS", "PHI", "RTET", "IRSD", "PAS", "PFT", "IRS", and
#&gt;     "IRFT"; one can still force the use of the bias correction by
#&gt;     explicitly setting the add argument to some non-zero value
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added clim argument to summary.escalc()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added ilim argument to trimfill()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - labbe() gains lty argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - labbe() now (invisibly) returns a data frame with the coordinates of
#&gt;     the points that were drawn (which may be useful for manual labeling
#&gt;     of points in the plot)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a print method for profile.rma objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - profile.rma.mv() now check whether any of the profiled
#&gt;     log-likelihood values is larger than the log-likelihood of the
#&gt;     fitted model (using numerical tolerance given by lltol) and issues a
#&gt;     warning if so
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - profile.rma.uni(), profile.rma.mv(), and plot.profile.rma() gain
#&gt;     cline argument; plot.profile.rma() gains xlim, ylab, and main
#&gt;     arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed an issue with robust.rma.mv() when the model was fitted with
#&gt;     sparse=TRUE (thanks to Roger Martineau for noting the problem)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - various method functions (fitted(), resid(), predict(), etc.) behave
#&gt;     in a more consistent manner when model omitted studies with missings
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict.rma() gains vcov argument; when set to TRUE, the variance-
#&gt;     covariance matrix of the predicted values is also returned
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - vcov.rma() can now also return the variance-covariance matrix of the
#&gt;     fitted values (type="fitted") and the residuals (type="resid")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added $&lt;- and as.matrix() methods for list.rma objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed error in simulate.rma() that would generate too many samples
#&gt;     for rma.mv models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added undocumented argument time to all model fitting functions; if
#&gt;     set to TRUE, the model fitting time is printed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added more tests (also for parallel operations); also, all tests
#&gt;     updated to use proper tolerances instead of rounding
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - reorganized the documentation a bit
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 2.0-0 (2017-06-22)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added simulate() method for rma objects; added MASS to Suggests
#&gt;     (since simulating for rma.mv objects requires mvrnorm() from MASS)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance.rma.mv() now works properly even when there are
#&gt;     missing values in the data
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - residuals() gains type argument and can compute Pearson residuals
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the newmods argument in predict() can now be a named vector or a
#&gt;     matrix/data frame with column names that get properly matched up
#&gt;     with the variables in the model
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added ranef.rma.mv() for extracting the BLUPs of the random effects
#&gt;     for rma.mv models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - all functions that repeatedly refit models now have the option to
#&gt;     show a progress bar
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added ranktest.default(), so user can now pass the outcomes and
#&gt;     corresponding sampling variances directly to the function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added regtest.default(), so user can now pass the outcomes and
#&gt;     corresponding sampling variances directly to the function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.default() gains subset argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.default() and funnel.rma() gain col and bg arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - plot.profile.rma() gains ylab argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more consistent handling of robust.rma objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added location-scale model
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a print method for rma.gosh objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the (log) relative risk is now called the (log) risk ratio in all
#&gt;     help files, plots, code, and comments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now compute outcome measures based on paired binary
#&gt;     data ("MPRR", "MPOR", "MPRD", "MPORC", and "MPPETO")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now compute (semi-)partial correlation coefficients
#&gt;     ("PCOR", "ZPCOR", "SPCOR")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now compute measures of variability for single groups
#&gt;     ("CVLN", "SDLN") and for the difference in variability between two
#&gt;     groups ("CVR", "VR"); also the log transformed mean ("MNLN") has
#&gt;     been added for consistency
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now compute the sampling variance for measure="PHI" for
#&gt;     studies using stratified sampling (vtpye="ST")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the [ method for escalc objects now properly handles the ni and slab
#&gt;     attributes and does a better job of cleaning out superfluous
#&gt;     variable name information
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added rbind() method for escalc objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added as.data.frame() method for list.rma objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.pagliaro1992) for another illustration of a
#&gt;     network meta-analysis
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.laopaiboon2015) on the effectiveness of
#&gt;     azithromycin for treating lower respiratory tract infections
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() and rma.mv() now check if the ratio of the largest to
#&gt;     smallest sampling variance is very large; results may not be stable
#&gt;     then (and very large ratios typically indicate wrongly coded data)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - model fitting functions now check if extra/superfluous arguments are
#&gt;     specified via ... and issues are warning if so
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - instead of defining own generic ranef(), import ranef() from nlme
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - improved output formatting
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added more tests (but disabled a few tests on CRAN to avoid some
#&gt;     issues when R is compiled with --disable-long-double)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some general code cleanup
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - renamed diagram_metafor.pdf vignette to just diagram.pdf
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - minor updates in the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-9 (2016-09-25)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - started to use git as version control system, GitHub to host the
#&gt;     repository (https://github.com/wviechtb/metafor) for the development
#&gt;     version of the package, Travis CI as continuous integration service
#&gt;     (https://travis-ci.org/wviechtb/metafor), and Codecov for automated
#&gt;     code coverage reporting (https://codecov.io/github/wviechtb/metafor)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument knha in rma.uni() and argument tdist in rma.glmm() and
#&gt;     rma.mv() are now superseded by argument test in all three functions;
#&gt;     for backwards compatibility, the knha and tdist arguments still
#&gt;     work, but are no longer documented
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma(yi, vi, weights=1, test="knha") now yields the same results as
#&gt;     rma(yi, vi, weighted=FALSE, test="knha") (but use of the Knapp and
#&gt;     Hartung method in the context of an unweighted analysis remains an
#&gt;     experimental feature)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - one can now pass an escalc object directly to rma.uni(), which then
#&gt;     tries to automatically determine the yi and vi variables in the data
#&gt;     frame (thanks to Christian Roever for the suggestion)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() can now also be used to convert a regular data frame to an
#&gt;     escalc object
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for measure="UCOR", the exact bias-correction is now used (instead
#&gt;     of the approximation); when vtype="UB", the exact equation is now
#&gt;     used to compute the unbiased estimate of the variance of the
#&gt;     bias-corrected correlation coefficient; hence gsl is now a suggested
#&gt;     package (needed to compute the hypergeometric function) and is
#&gt;     loaded when required
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cooks.distance() now also works with rma.mv objects; and since model
#&gt;     fitting can take some time, an option to show a progress bar has
#&gt;     been added
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed an issue with robust.rma.mv() throwing errors when the model
#&gt;     was fitted with sparse=TRUE
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed an error with robust.rma.mv() when the model was fitted with
#&gt;     user-defined weights (or a user-defined weight matrix)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added ranef() for extracting the BLUPs of the random effects (only
#&gt;     for rma.uni objects at the moment)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - reverted back to the pre-1.1-0 way of computing p-values for
#&gt;     individual coefficients in permutest.rma.uni(), that is, the p-value
#&gt;     is computed with mean(abs(z_perm) &gt;= abs(z_obs) - tol) (where tol is
#&gt;     a numerical tolerance)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - permutest.rma.uni() gains permci argument, which can be used to
#&gt;     obtain permutation-based CIs of the model coefficients (note that
#&gt;     this is computationally very demanding and may take a long time to
#&gt;     complete)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() continues to work even when the saturated model cannot be
#&gt;     fitted (although the tests for heterogeneity are not available then)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() now allows control over the arguments used for
#&gt;     method.args (via control=list(hessianCtrl=list(...))) passed to
#&gt;     hessian() (from the numDeriv package) when using model="CM.EL" and
#&gt;     measure="OR"
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in rma.glmm(), default method.args value for r passed to hessian()
#&gt;     has been increased to 16 (while this slows things down a bit, this
#&gt;     appears to improve the accuracy of the numerical approximation to
#&gt;     the Hessian, especially when tau^2 is close to 0)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() and addpoly() functions now have a new argument
#&gt;     called width, which provides manual control over the width of the
#&gt;     annotation columns; this is useful when creating complex forest
#&gt;     plots with a monospaced font and we want to ensure that all
#&gt;     annotations are properly lined up at the decimal point
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the annotations created by the various forest() and addpoly()
#&gt;     functions are now a bit more compact by default
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more flexible efac argument in the various forest() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - trailing zeros in the axis labels are now dropped in forest and
#&gt;     funnel plots by default; but trailing zeros can be retained by
#&gt;     specifying a numeric (and not an integer) value for the digits
#&gt;     argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added funnel.default(), which directly takes as input a vector with
#&gt;     the observed effect sizes or outcomes and the corresponding sampling
#&gt;     variances, standard errors, and/or sample sizes
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added plot.profile.rma(), a plot method for objects returned by the
#&gt;     profile.rma.uni() and profile.rma.mv() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - simplified baujat.rma.uni(), baujat.rma.mh(), and baujat.rma.peto()
#&gt;     to baujat.rma(), which now handles objects of class rma.uni, rma.mh,
#&gt;     and rma.peto
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - baujat.rma() gains argument symbol for more control over the
#&gt;     plotting symbol
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - labbe() gains a grid argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more logical placement of labels in qqnorm.rma.uni(),
#&gt;     qqnorm.rma.mh(), and qqnorm.rma.peto() functions (and more control
#&gt;     thereof)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - qqnorm.rma.uni() gains lty argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added gosh.rma() and plot.gosh.rma() for creating GOSH (i.e.,
#&gt;     graphical display of study heterogeneity) plots based on Olkin et
#&gt;     al. (2012)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in the (rare) case where all observed outcomes are exactly equal to
#&gt;     each other, test="knha" (i.e., knha=TRUE) in rma() now leads to more
#&gt;     appropriate results
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - updated datasets so those containing precomputed effect size
#&gt;     estimates or observed outcomes are already declared to be escalc
#&gt;     objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new datasets (dat.egger2001 and dat.li2007) on the
#&gt;     effectiveness of intravenous magnesium in acute myocardial
#&gt;     infarction
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - methods package is now under Depends (in addition to Matrix), so
#&gt;     that rma.mv(..., sparse=TRUE) always works, even under Rscript
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some general code cleanup
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added more tests (and used a more consistent naming scheme for
#&gt;     tests)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-8 (2015-09-28)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - due to more stringent package testing, it is increasingly difficult
#&gt;     to ensure that the package passes all checks on older versions of R;
#&gt;     from now on, the package will therefore require, and be checked
#&gt;     under, only the current (and the development) version of R
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added graphics, grDevices, and methods to Imports (due to recent
#&gt;     change in how CRAN checks packages)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the struct argument for rma.mv() now also allows for "ID" and
#&gt;     "DIAG", which are identical to the "CS" and "HCS" structures, but
#&gt;     with the correlation parameter fixed to 0
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added robust() for (cluster) robust tests and confidence intervals
#&gt;     for rma.uni and rma.mv models (this uses a robust sandwich-type
#&gt;     estimator of the variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects
#&gt;     along the lines of the Eicker-Huber-White method)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - confint() now works for models fitted with the rma.mv() function;
#&gt;     for variance and correlation parameters, the function provides
#&gt;     profile likelihood confidence intervals; the output generated by the
#&gt;     confint() function has been adjusted in general to make the
#&gt;     formatting more consistent across the different model types
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for objects of class rma.mv, profile() now provides profile plots
#&gt;     for all (non-fixed) variance and correlation components of the model
#&gt;     when no component is specified by the user (via the sigma2, tau2,
#&gt;     rho, gamma2, or phi arguments)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for measure="MD" and measure="ROM", one can now choose between
#&gt;     vtype="LS" (the default) and vtype="HO"; the former computes the
#&gt;     sampling variances without assuming homoscedasticity, while the
#&gt;     latter assumes homoscedasticity
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - multiple model objects can now be passed to the fitstats(), AIC(),
#&gt;     and BIC() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - check for duplicates in the slab argument is now done after any
#&gt;     subsetting is done (as suggested by Michael Dewey)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() now again works when using add=0, in which case some of
#&gt;     the observed outcomes (e.g., log odds or log odds ratios) may be NA
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - when using rma.glmm() with model="CM.EL", the saturated model (used
#&gt;     to compute the Wald-type and likelihood ratio tests for the presence
#&gt;     of (residual) heterogeneity) often fails to converge; the function
#&gt;     now continues to run (instead of stopping with an error) and simply
#&gt;     omits the test results from the output
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - when using rma.glmm() with model="CM.EL" and inversion of the
#&gt;     Hessian fails via the Choleski factorization, the function now makes
#&gt;     another attempt via the QR decomposition (even when this works, a
#&gt;     warning is issued)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for rma.glmm(), BIC and AICc values were switched around; corrected
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more use of suppressWarnings() is made when functions repeatedly
#&gt;     need to fit the same model, such as cumul(), influence(), and
#&gt;     profile(); that way, one does not get inundated with the same
#&gt;     warning(s)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some (overdue) updates to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-7 (2015-05-22)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - default optimizer for rma.mv() changed to nlminb() (instead of
#&gt;     optim() with "Nelder-Mead"); extensive testing indicated that
#&gt;     nlminb() (and also optim() with "BFGS") is typically quicker and
#&gt;     more robust; note that this is in principle a non-backwards
#&gt;     compatible change, but really a necessary one; and you can always
#&gt;     revert to the old behavior with control=list(optimizer="optim",
#&gt;     optmethod="Nelder-Mead")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - all tests have been updated in accordance with the recommended
#&gt;     syntax of the testthat package; for example, expect_equivalent(x,y)
#&gt;     is used instead of test_that(x, is_equivalent_to(y))
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - changed a few is_identical_to() comparisons to expect_equivalent()
#&gt;     ones (that failed on Sparc Solaris)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-6 (2015-05-07)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel() now works again for rma.glmm objects (note to self: quit
#&gt;     breaking things that work!)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() will now only issue a warning (and not an error) when the
#&gt;     Hessian for the saturated model cannot be inverted (which is needed
#&gt;     to compute the Wald-type test for heterogeneity, so the test
#&gt;     statistic is then simply set to NA)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now allows for two terms of the form ~ inner | outer; the
#&gt;     variance components corresponding to such a structure are called
#&gt;     gamma2 and correlations are called phi; other functions that work
#&gt;     with objects of class rma.mv have been updated accordingly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now provides (even) more optimizer choices: nlm() from the
#&gt;     stats package, hjk() and nmk() from the dfoptim package, and
#&gt;     ucminf() from the ucminf package; choose the desired optimizer via
#&gt;     the control argument (e.g., control=list(optimizer="nlm"))
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - profile.rma.uni() and profile.rma.mv() now can do parallel
#&gt;     processing (which is especially relevant for rma.mv objects, where
#&gt;     profiling is crucial and model fitting can be slow)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various confint() functions now have a transf argument (to apply
#&gt;     some kind of transformation to the model coefficients and confidence
#&gt;     interval bounds); coefficients and bounds for objects of class
#&gt;     rma.mh and rma.peto are no longer automatically transformed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions no longer enforce that the actual
#&gt;     x-axis limits (alim) encompass the observed outcomes to be plotted;
#&gt;     also, outcomes below or above the actual x-axis limits are no longer
#&gt;     shown
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions now provide control over the
#&gt;     horizontal lines (at the top/bottom) that are automatically added to
#&gt;     the plot via the lty argument (this also allows for removing them);
#&gt;     also, the vertical reference line is now placed behind the
#&gt;     points/CIs
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.default() now has argument col which can be used to specify
#&gt;     the color(s) to be used for drawing the study labels, points, CIs,
#&gt;     and annotations
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the efac argument for forest.rma() now also allows two values, the
#&gt;     first for the arrows and CI limits, the second for summary estimates
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - corrected some axis labels in various plots when measure="PLO"
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - axes in labbe() plots now have "(Group 1)" and "(Group 2)" added by
#&gt;     default
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - anova.rma() gains argument L for specifying linear combinations of
#&gt;     the coefficients in the model that should be tested to be zero
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in case removal of a row of data would lead to one or more
#&gt;     inestimable model coefficients, baujat(), cooks.distance(),
#&gt;     dfbetas(), influence(), and rstudent() could fail for rma.uni
#&gt;     objects; such cases are now handled properly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for models with moderators, the predict() function now shows the
#&gt;     study labels when they have been specified by the user (and newmods
#&gt;     is not used)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - if there is only one fixed effect (model coefficient) in the model,
#&gt;     the print.infl.rma.uni() function now shows the DFBETAS values with
#&gt;     the other case diagnostics in a single table (for easier
#&gt;     inspection); if there is more than one fixed effect, a separate
#&gt;     table is still used for the DFBETAS values (with one column for each
#&gt;     coefficient)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added measure="SMCRH" to the escalc() function for the standardized
#&gt;     mean change using raw score standardization with heteroscedastic
#&gt;     population variances at the two measurement occasions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added measure="ROMC" to the escalc() function for the (log
#&gt;     transformed) ratio of means (response ratio) when the means reflect
#&gt;     two measurement occasions (e.g., for a single group of people) and
#&gt;     hence are correlated
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added own function for computing/estimating the tetrachoric
#&gt;     correlation coefficient (for measure="RTET"); package therefore no
#&gt;     longer suggests polycor but now suggest mvtnorm (which is loaded as
#&gt;     needed)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - element fill returned by trimfill.rma.uni() is now a logical vector
#&gt;     (instead of a 0/1 dummy variable)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - print.list.rma() now also returns the printed results invisibly as a
#&gt;     data frame
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.senn2013) as another illustration of a
#&gt;     network meta-analysis
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - metafor now depends on at least version 3.1.0 of R
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-5 (2014-11-24)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - moved the stats and Matrix packages from Depends to Imports; as a
#&gt;     result, had to add utils to Imports; moved the Formula package from
#&gt;     Depends to Suggests
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added update.rma() function (for updating/refitting a model); model
#&gt;     objects also now store and keep the call
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the vcov() function now also extracts the marginal
#&gt;     variance-covariance matrix of the observed effect sizes or outcomes
#&gt;     from a fitted model (of class rma.uni or rma.mv)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now makes use of the Cholesky decomposition when there is a
#&gt;     random = ~ inner | outer formula and struct="UN"; this is
#&gt;     numerically more stable than the old approach that avoided
#&gt;     non-positive definite solutions by forcing the log-likelihood to be
#&gt;     -Inf in those cases; the old behavior can be restored with control =
#&gt;     list(cholesky=FALSE)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now requires the inner variable in an ~ inner | outer
#&gt;     formula to be a factor or character variable (except when struct is
#&gt;     "AR" or "HAR"); use ~ factor(inner) | outer in case it isn't
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - anova.rma.uni() function changed to anova.rma() that works now for
#&gt;     both rma.uni and rma.mv objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the profile.rma.mv() function now omits the number of the variance
#&gt;     or correlation component from the plot title and x-axis label when
#&gt;     the model only includes one of the respective parameters
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - profile() functions now pass on the ... argument also to the title()
#&gt;     function used to create the figure titles (esp. relevant when using
#&gt;     the cex.main argument)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the drop00 argument of the rma.mh() and rma.peto() functions now
#&gt;     also accepts a vector with two logicals, the first applies when
#&gt;     calculating the observed outcomes, the second when applying the
#&gt;     Mantel-Haenszel or Peto's method
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - weights.rma.uni() now shows the correct weights when weighted=FALSE
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument showweight renamed to showweights in the forest.default()
#&gt;     and forest.rma() functions (more consistent with the naming of the
#&gt;     various weights() functions)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added model.matrix.rma() function (to extract the model matrix from
#&gt;     objects of class rma)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel() and radial() now (invisibly) return data frames with the
#&gt;     coordinates of the points that were drawn (may be useful for manual
#&gt;     labeling of points in the plots)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - permutest.rma.uni() function now uses a numerical tolerance when
#&gt;     making comparisons (&gt;= or &lt;=) between an observed test statistic and
#&gt;     the test statistic under the permuted data; when using random
#&gt;     permutations, the function now ensures that the very first
#&gt;     permutation correspond to the original data
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - corrected some missing/redundant row/column labels in some output
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - most require() calls replaced with requireNamespace() to avoid
#&gt;     altering the search path (hopefully this won't break stuff ...)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some non-visible changes including more use of some (non-exported)
#&gt;     helper functions for common tasks
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - dataset dat.collins91985a updated (including all reported outcomes
#&gt;     and some more information about the various trials)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - oh, and guess what? I updated the documentation ...
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-4 (2014-07-30)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added method="GENQ" to rma.uni() for the generalized Q-statistic
#&gt;     estimator of tau^2, which allows for used-defined weights (note: the
#&gt;     DL and HE estimators are just special cases of this method)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - when the model was fitted with method="GENQ", then confint() will
#&gt;     now use the generalized Q-statistic method to construct the
#&gt;     corresponding confidence interval for tau^2 (thanks to Dan Jackson
#&gt;     for the code); the iterative method used to obtain the CI makes use
#&gt;     of Farebrother's algorithm as implemented in the CompQuadForm
#&gt;     package
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight improvements in how the rma.uni() function handles
#&gt;     non-positive sampling variances
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni(), rma.mv(), and rma.glmm() now try to detect and remove any
#&gt;     redundant predictors before the model fitting; therefore, if there
#&gt;     are exact linear relationships among the predictor variables (i.e.,
#&gt;     perfect multicollinearity), terms are removed to obtain a set of
#&gt;     predictors that is no longer perfectly multicollinear (a warning is
#&gt;     issued when this happens); note that the order of how the variables
#&gt;     are specified in the model formula can influence which terms are
#&gt;     removed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the last update introduced an error in how hat values were computed
#&gt;     when the model was fitted with the rma() function using the Knapp &amp;
#&gt;     Hartung method (i.e., when knha=TRUE); this has been fixed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - regtest() no longer works (for now) with rma.mv objects (it wasn't
#&gt;     meant to in the first place); if you want to run something along the
#&gt;     same lines, just consider adding some measure of the precision of
#&gt;     the observed outcomes (e.g., their standard errors) as a predictor
#&gt;     to the model
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "sqrtni" and "sqrtninv" as possible options for the predictor
#&gt;     argument of regtest()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more optimizers are now available for the rma.mv() function via the
#&gt;     nloptr package by setting control = list(optimizer="nloptr"); when
#&gt;     using this optimizer, the default is to use the BOBYQA
#&gt;     implementation from that package with a relative convergence
#&gt;     criterion of 1e-8 on the function value (see documentation on how to
#&gt;     change these defaults)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict.rma() function now works for rma.mv objects with multiple
#&gt;     tau^2 values even if the user specifies the newmods argument but not
#&gt;     the tau2.levels argument (but a warning is issued and the prediction
#&gt;     intervals are not computed)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument var.names now works properly in escalc() when the user has
#&gt;     not made use of the data argument (thanks to Jarrett Byrnes for
#&gt;     bringing this to my attention)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added plot() function for cumulative random-effects models results
#&gt;     as obtained with the cumul.rma.uni() function; the plot shows the
#&gt;     model estimate on the x-axis and the corresponding tau^2 estimate on
#&gt;     the y-axis in the cumulative order of the results
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed the omitted offset term in the underlying model fitted by the
#&gt;     rma.glmm() function when method="ML", measure="IRR", and
#&gt;     model="UM.FS", that is, when fitting a mixed-effects Poisson
#&gt;     regression model with fixed study effects to two-group event count
#&gt;     data (thanks to Peter Konings for pointing out this error)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added two new datasets (dat.bourassa1996, dat.riley2003)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function replmiss() (just a useful helper function)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - package now uses LazyData: TRUE
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation (do I still need to mention
#&gt;     this every time?)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-3 (2014-05-05)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some minor tweaks to rma.uni() that should be user transparent
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() now has a weights argument, allowing the user to specify
#&gt;     arbitrary user-defined weights; all functions affected by this have
#&gt;     been updated accordingly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - better handling of mismatched length of yi and ni vectors in
#&gt;     rma.uni() and rma.mv() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - subsetting is now handled as early as possible within functions with
#&gt;     subsetting capabilities; this avoids some (rare) cases where studies
#&gt;     ultimately excluded by the subsetting could still affect the results
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some general tweaks to rma.mv() that should make it a bit faster
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument V of rma.mv() now also accepts a list of var-cov matrices
#&gt;     for the observed effects or outcomes; from the list elements, the
#&gt;     full (block diagonal) var-cov matrix V is then automatically
#&gt;     constructed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now has a new argument W allowing the user to specify
#&gt;     arbitrary user-defined weights or an arbitrary weight matrix
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now has a new argument sparse; by setting this to TRUE, the
#&gt;     function uses sparse matrix objects to the extent possible; this can
#&gt;     speed up model fitting substantially for certain models (hence, the
#&gt;     metafor package now depends on the Matrix package)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now allows for struct="AR" and struct="HAR", to fit models
#&gt;     with (heteroscedastic) autoregressive (AR1) structures among the
#&gt;     true effects (useful for meta-analyses of studies reporting outcomes
#&gt;     at multiple time points)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now has a new argument Rscale which can be used to control
#&gt;     how matrices specified via the R argument are scaled (see docs for
#&gt;     more details)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mv() now only checks for missing values in the rows of the lower
#&gt;     triangular part of the V matrix (including the diagonal); this way,
#&gt;     if Vi = matrix(c(.5,NA,NA,NA), nrow=2, ncol=2) is the var-cov matrix
#&gt;     of the sampling errors for a particular study with two outcomes,
#&gt;     then only the second row/column needs to be removed before the model
#&gt;     fitting (and not the entire study)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added five new datasets (dat.begg1989, dat.ishak2007, dat.fine1993,
#&gt;     dat.konstantopoulos2011, and dat.hasselblad1998) to provide further
#&gt;     illustrations of the use of the rma.mv() function (for meta-analyses
#&gt;     combining controlled and uncontrolled studies, for meta-analyses of
#&gt;     longitudinal studies, for multilevel meta-analyses, and for network
#&gt;     meta-analyses / mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added rstandard.rma.mv() function to compute standardized residuals
#&gt;     for models fitted with the rma.mv() function (rstudent.rma.mv() to
#&gt;     be added at a later point); also added hatvalues.rma.mv() for
#&gt;     computing the hat values and weights.rma.uni() for computing the
#&gt;     weights (i.e., the diagonal elements of the weight matrix)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various weights() functions now have a new argument type to
#&gt;     indicate whether only the diagonal elements of the weight matrix
#&gt;     (default) or the entire weight matrix should be returned
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various hatvalues() functions now have a new argument type to
#&gt;     indicate whether only the diagonal elements of the hat matrix
#&gt;     (default) or the entire hat matrix should be returned
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict.rma() function now works properly for rma.mv objects (also
#&gt;     has a new argument tau2.levels to specify, where applicable, the
#&gt;     levels of the inner factor when computing prediction intervals)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.rma() function now provides a bit more control over the color
#&gt;     of the summary polygon and is now compatible with rma.mv objects;
#&gt;     also, has a new argument lty, which provides more control over the
#&gt;     line type for the individual CIs and the prediction interval
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - addpoly.default() and addpoly.rma() now have a border argument (for
#&gt;     consistency with the forest.rma() function); addpoly.rma() now
#&gt;     yields the correct CI bounds when the model was fitted with
#&gt;     knha=TRUE
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest.cumul.rma() now provides the correct CI bounds when the
#&gt;     models were fitted with the Knapp &amp; Hartung method (i.e., when
#&gt;     knha=TRUE in the original rma() function call)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions now return information about the
#&gt;     chosen values for arguments xlim, alim, at, ylim, rows, cex,
#&gt;     cex.lab, and cex.axis invisibly (useful for tweaking the default
#&gt;     values); thanks to Michael Dewey for the suggestion
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the various forest() functions now have a new argument, clim, to set
#&gt;     limits for the confidence/prediction interval bounds
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cumul.mh() and cumul.peto() now get the order of the studies right
#&gt;     when there are missing values in the data
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the transf argument of leave1out.rma.mh(), leave1out.rma.peto(),
#&gt;     cumul.rma.mh(), and cumul.rma.peto() should now be used to specify
#&gt;     the actual function for the transformation (the former behavior of
#&gt;     setting this argument to TRUE to exponentiate log RRs, log ORs, or
#&gt;     log IRRs still works for back-compatibility); this is more
#&gt;     consistent with how the cumul.rma.uni() and leave1out.rma.uni()
#&gt;     functions work and is also more flexible
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added bldiag() function to construct a block diagonal matrix from (a
#&gt;     list of) matrices (may be needed to construct the V matrix when
#&gt;     using the rma.mv() function); bdiag() function from the Matrix
#&gt;     package does the same thing, but creates sparse matrix objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - profile.rma.mv() now has a startmethod argument; by setting this to
#&gt;     "prev", successive model fits are started at the parameter estimates
#&gt;     from the previous model fit; this may speed things up a bit; also,
#&gt;     the method for automatically choosing the xlim values has been
#&gt;     changed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight improvement to profile.rma.mv() function, which would throw
#&gt;     an error if the last model fit did not converge
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.linde2005) for replication of the analyses
#&gt;     in Viechtbauer (2007)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.molloy2014) for illustrating the
#&gt;     meta-analysis of (r-to-z transformed) correlation coefficients
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.gibson2002) to illustrate the combined
#&gt;     analysis of standardized mean differences and probit transformed
#&gt;     risk differences
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - computations in weights.mh() slightly changed to prevent integer
#&gt;     overflows for large counts
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - unnecessary warnings in transf.ipft.hm() are now suppressed (cases
#&gt;     that raised those warnings were already handled correctly)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in predict(), blup(), cumul(), and leave1out(), when using the
#&gt;     transf argument, the standard errors (which are NA) are no longer
#&gt;     shown in the output
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument slab in various functions will now also accept non-unique
#&gt;     study labels; make.unique() is used as needed to make them unique
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - vignettes("metafor") and vignettes("metafor_diagram") work again
#&gt;     (yes, I know they are not true vignettes in the strict sense, but I
#&gt;     think they should show up on the CRAN website for the package and
#&gt;     using a minimal valid Sweave document that is recognized by the R
#&gt;     build system makes that happen)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - escalc() and its summary() method now keep better track when the
#&gt;     data frame contains multiple columns with outcome or effect size
#&gt;     values (and corresponding sampling variances) for print formatting;
#&gt;     also simplified the class structure a bit (and hence,
#&gt;     print.summary.escalc() removed)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - summary.escalc() has a new argument H0 to specify the value of the
#&gt;     outcome under the null hypothesis for computing the test statistics
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added measures "OR2DN" and "D2ORN" to escalc() for transforming log
#&gt;     odds ratios to standardized mean differences and vice-versa, based
#&gt;     on the method of Cox &amp; Snell (1989), which assumes normally
#&gt;     distributed response variables within the two groups before the
#&gt;     dichotomization
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - permutest.rma.uni() function now catches an error when the number of
#&gt;     permutations requested is too large (for R to even create the
#&gt;     objects to store the results in) and produces a proper error message
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel.rma() function now allows the yaxis argument to be set to
#&gt;     "wi" so that the actual weights (in %) are placed on the y-axis
#&gt;     (useful when arbitrary user-defined have been specified)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for rma.glmm(), the control argument optCtrl is now used for passing
#&gt;     control arguments to all of the optimizers (hence, control arguments
#&gt;     nlminbCtrl and minqaCtrl are now defunct)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() should not throw an error anymore when including only a
#&gt;     single moderator/predictor in the model
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict.rma() now returns an object of class list.rma (therefore,
#&gt;     function print.predict.rma() has been removed)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for rma.list objects, added [, head(), and tail() methods
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - automated testing using the testthat package (still many more tests
#&gt;     to add, but finally made a start on this)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - encoding changed to UTF-8 (to use 'foreign characters' in the docs
#&gt;     and to make the HTML help files look a bit nicer)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - guess what? some improvements to the documentation! (also combined
#&gt;     some of the help files to reduce the size of the manual a bit; and
#&gt;     yes, it's still way too big)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-2 (2013-10-07)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function rma.mv() to fit multivariate/multilevel meta-analytic
#&gt;     models via appropriate linear (mixed-effects) models; this function
#&gt;     allows for modeling of non-independent sampling errors and/or true
#&gt;     effects and can be used for network meta-analyses, meta-analyses
#&gt;     accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, and other complicated
#&gt;     meta-analytic data structures
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the AICc to the information criteria computed by the various
#&gt;     model fitting functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - if the value of tau^2 is fixed by the user via the corresponding
#&gt;     argument in rma.uni(), then tau^2 is no longer counted as an
#&gt;     additional parameter for the computation of the information criteria
#&gt;     (i.e., AIC, BIC, and AICc)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni(), rma.glmm(), and rma.mv() now use a more stringent check
#&gt;     whether the model matrix is of full rank
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added profile() method functions for objects of class rma.uni and
#&gt;     rma.mv (can be used to obtain a plot of the profiled log-likelihood
#&gt;     as a function of a specific variance component or correlation
#&gt;     parameter of the model)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict.rma() function now has an intercept argument that allows the
#&gt;     user to decide whether the intercept term should be included when
#&gt;     calculating the predicted values (rare that this should be changed
#&gt;     from the default)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for rma.uni(), rma.glmm(), and rma.mv(), the control argument can
#&gt;     now also accept an integer value; values &gt; 1 generate more verbose
#&gt;     output about the progress inside of the function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() has been updated to work with lme4 1.0.x for fitting
#&gt;     various models; as a result, model="UM.RS" can only use nAGQ=1 at
#&gt;     the moment (hopefully this will change in the future)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the control argument of rma.glmm() can now be used to pass all
#&gt;     desired control arguments to the various functions and optimizers
#&gt;     used for the model fitting (admittedly the use of lists within this
#&gt;     argument is a bit unwieldy, but much more flexible)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mh() and rma.peto() also now have a verbose argument (not really
#&gt;     needed, but added for sake of consistency across functions)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed (silly) error that would prevent rma.glmm() from running for
#&gt;     measures "IRR", "PLO", and "IRLN" when there are missing values in
#&gt;     the data (lesson: add some missing values to datasets for the unit
#&gt;     tests!)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - a bit of code reorganization (should be user transparent)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - vignettes ("metafor" and "metafor_diagram") are now just 'other
#&gt;     files' in the doc directory (as these were not true vignettes to
#&gt;     begin with)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation (as always)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-1 (2013-07-20)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mh() now also implements the Mantel-Haenszel method for
#&gt;     incidence rate differences (measure="IRD")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - when analyzing incidence rate ratios (measure="IRR") with the
#&gt;     rma.mh() function, the Mantel-Haenszel test for person-time data is
#&gt;     now also provided
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mh() has a new argument correct (default is TRUE) to indicate
#&gt;     whether the continuity correction should be applied when computing
#&gt;     the (Cochran-)Mantel-Haenszel test statistic
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - renamed elements CMH and CMHp (for the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test
#&gt;     statistic and corresponding p-value) to MH and MHp
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function baujat() to create Baujat plots
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.pignon2000) to illustrate the use of the
#&gt;     baujat() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function to.table() to convert data from vector format into
#&gt;     the corresponding table format
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function to.long() to convert data from vector format into the
#&gt;     corresponding long format
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() now even runs when k=1 (yielding trivial results)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - for models with an intercept and moderators, rma.glmm() now
#&gt;     internally rescales (non-dummy) variables to z-scores during the
#&gt;     model fitting (this improves the stability of the model fitting,
#&gt;     especially when model="CM.EL"); results are given after
#&gt;     back-scaling, so this should be transparent to the user
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in rma.glmm(), default number of quadrature points (nAGQ) is now 7
#&gt;     (setting this to 100 was a bit overkill)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - a few more error checks here and there for misspecified arguments
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.9-0 (2013-06-21)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - vignette renamed to metafor so vignette("metafor") works now
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a diagram to the documentation, showing the various functions
#&gt;     in the metafor package (and how they relate to each other); can be
#&gt;     loaded with vignette("metafor_diagram")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - anova.rma.uni() function can now also be used to test (sub)sets of
#&gt;     model coefficients with a Wald-type test when a single model is
#&gt;     passed to the function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the pseudo R^2 statistic is now automatically calculated by the
#&gt;     rma.uni() function and supplied in the output (only for
#&gt;     mixed-effects models and when the model includes an intercept, so
#&gt;     that the random- effects model is clearly nested within the
#&gt;     mixed-effects model)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - component VAF is now called R2 in anova.rma.uni() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added function hc() that carries out a random-effects model analysis
#&gt;     using the method by Henmi and Copas (2010); thanks to Michael Dewey
#&gt;     for the suggestion and providing the code
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new dataset (dat.lee2004), which was used in the article by
#&gt;     Henmi and Copas (2010) to illustrate their method
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - fixed missing x-axis labels in the forest() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.glmm() now computes Hessian matrices via the numDeriv package
#&gt;     when model="CM.EL" and measure="OR" (i.e., for the conditional
#&gt;     logistic model with exact likelihood); so numDeriv is now a
#&gt;     suggested package and is loaded within rma.glmm() when required
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - trimfill.rma.uni() now also implements the "Q0" estimator (although
#&gt;     the "L0" and "R0" estimators are generally to be preferred)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - trimfill.rma.uni() now also calculates the SE of the estimated
#&gt;     number of missing studies and, for estimator "R0", provides a formal
#&gt;     test of the null hypothesis that the number of missing studies on a
#&gt;     given side is zero
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new dataset (dat.bangertdrowns2004)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the level argument in various functions now either accepts a value
#&gt;     representing a percentage or a proportion (values greater than 1 are
#&gt;     assumed to be a percentage)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - summary.escalc() now computes confidence intervals correctly when
#&gt;     using the transf argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - computation of Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic in rma.mh() changed
#&gt;     slightly to avoid integer overflow with very big counts
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some internal improvements with respect to object attributes that
#&gt;     were getting discarded when subsetting
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some general code cleanup
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.8-0 (2013-04-11)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added additional clarifications about the change score outcome
#&gt;     measures ("MC", "SMCC", and "SMCR") to the help file for the
#&gt;     escalc() function and changed the code so that "SMCR" no longer
#&gt;     expects argument sd2i to be specified (which is not needed anyways)
#&gt;     (thanks to Markus Kösters for bringing this to my attention)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - sampling variance for the biserial correlation coefficient ("RBIS")
#&gt;     is now calculated in a slightly more accurate way
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - llplot() now properly scales the log-likelihoods
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - argument which in the plot.infl.rma.uni() function has been replaced
#&gt;     with argument plotinf which can now also be set to FALSE to suppress
#&gt;     plotting of the various case diagnostics altogether
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - labeling of the axes in labbe() plots is now correct for odds ratios
#&gt;     (and transformations thereof)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added two new datasets (dat.nielweise2007 and dat.nielweise2008) to
#&gt;     illustrate some methods/models from the rma.glmm() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a new dataset (dat.yusuf1985) to illustrate the use of
#&gt;     rma.peto()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - test for heterogeneity is now conducted by the rma.peto() function
#&gt;     exactly as described by Yusuf et al. (1985)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in rma.glmm(), default number of quadrature points (nAGQ) is now 100
#&gt;     (which is quite a bit slower, but should provide more than
#&gt;     sufficient accuracy in most cases)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the standard errors of the HS and DL estimators of tau^2 are now
#&gt;     correctly computed when tau^2 is prespecified by the user in the
#&gt;     rma() function; in addition, the standard error of the SJ estimator
#&gt;     is also now provided when tau^2 is prespecified
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() and rma.glmm() now use a better method to check whether
#&gt;     the model matrix is of full rank
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - I^2 and H^2 statistics are now also calculated for mixed-effects
#&gt;     models by the rma.uni() and rma.glmm() function; confint.rma.uni()
#&gt;     provides the corresponding confidence intervals for rma.uni models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - various print() methods now have a new argument called signif.stars,
#&gt;     which defaults to getOption("show.signif.stars") (which by default
#&gt;     is TRUE) to determine whether the infamous 'significance stars'
#&gt;     should be printed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight changes in wording in the output produced by the
#&gt;     print.rma.uni() and print.rma.glmm() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.7-0 (2013-02-06)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added rma.glmm() function for fitting of appropriate generalized
#&gt;     linear (mixed-effects) models when analyzing odds ratios, incidence
#&gt;     rate ratios, proportions, or rates; the function makes use of the
#&gt;     lme4 and BiasedUrn packages; these are now suggested packages and
#&gt;     loaded within rma.glmm() only when required (this makes for faster
#&gt;     loading of the metafor package)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added several method functions for objects of class rma.glmm (not
#&gt;     all methods yet implemented; to be completed in the future)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() now allows the user to specify a formula for the yi
#&gt;     argument, so instead of rma(yi, vi, mods=~mod1+mod2), one can
#&gt;     specify the same model with rma(yi~mod1+mod2, vi)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() now has a weights argument to specify the inverse of the
#&gt;     sampling variances (instead of using the vi or sei arguments); for
#&gt;     now, this is all this argument should be used for (in the future,
#&gt;     this argument may potentially be used to allow the user to define
#&gt;     alternative weights)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() now checks whether the model matrix is not of full rank
#&gt;     and issues an error accordingly (instead of the rather cryptic error
#&gt;     that was issued before)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.uni() now has a verbose argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - coef.rma() now returns only the model coefficients (this change was
#&gt;     necessary to make the package compatible with the multcomp package;
#&gt;     see help(rma) for an example); use coef(summary()) to obtain the
#&gt;     full table of results
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the escalc() function now does some more extensive error checking
#&gt;     for misspecified data and some unusual cases
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - append argument is now TRUE by default in the escalc() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - objects generated by the escalc() function now have their own class
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added print() and summary() methods for objects of class escalc
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added [ and cbind() methods for objects of class escalc
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a few additional arguments to the escalc() function (i.e.,
#&gt;     slab, subset, var.names, replace, digits)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added drop00 argument to the escalc(), rma.uni(), rma.mh(), and
#&gt;     rma.peto() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "MN", "MC", "SMCC", and "SMCR" measures to the escalc() and
#&gt;     rma.uni() functions for the raw mean, the raw mean change, and the
#&gt;     standardized mean change (with change score or raw score
#&gt;     standardization) as possible outcome measures
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the "IRFT" measure in the escalc() and rma.uni() functions is now
#&gt;     computed with 1/2*(sqrt(xi/ti) + sqrt(xi/ti+1/ti)) which is more
#&gt;     consistent with the definition of the Freeman-Tukey transformation
#&gt;     for proportions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "RTET" measure to the escalc() and rma.uni() functions to
#&gt;     compute the tetrachoric correlation coefficient based on 2x2 table
#&gt;     data (the polycor package is therefore now a suggested package,
#&gt;     which is loaded within escalc() only when required)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "RPB" and "RBIS" measures to the escalc() and rma.uni()
#&gt;     functions to compute the point-biserial and biserial correlation
#&gt;     coefficient based on means and standard deviations
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "PBIT" and "OR2D" measures to the escalc() and rma.uni()
#&gt;     functions to compute the standardized mean difference based on 2x2
#&gt;     table data
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the "D2OR" measure to the escalc() and rma.uni() functions to
#&gt;     compute the log odds ratio based on the standardized mean difference
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "SMDH" measure to the escalc() and rma.uni() functions to
#&gt;     compute the standardized mean difference without assuming equal
#&gt;     population variances
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added "ARAW", "AHW", and "ABT" measures to the escalc() and
#&gt;     rma.uni() functions for the raw value of Cronbach's alpha, the
#&gt;     transformation suggested by Hakstian &amp; Whalen (1976), and the
#&gt;     transformation suggested by Bonett (2002) for the meta-analysis of
#&gt;     reliability coefficients (see help(escalc) for details)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - corrected a small mistake in the equation used to compute the
#&gt;     sampling variance of the phi coefficient (measure="PHI") in the
#&gt;     escalc() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the permutest.rma.uni() function now uses an algorithm to find only
#&gt;     the unique permutations of the model matrix (which may be much
#&gt;     smaller than the total number of permutations), making the exact
#&gt;     permutation test feasible in a larger set of circumstances (thanks
#&gt;     to John Hodgson for making me aware of this issue and to Hans-Jörg
#&gt;     Viechtbauer for coming up with a recursive algorithm for finding the
#&gt;     unique permutations)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - prediction interval in forest.rma() is now indicated with a dotted
#&gt;     (instead of a dashed) line; ends of the interval are now marked with
#&gt;     vertical bars
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - completely rewrote the funnel.rma() function which now supports many
#&gt;     more options for the values to put on the y-axis; trimfill.rma.uni()
#&gt;     function was adapted accordingly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - removed the ni argument from the regtest.rma() function; instead,
#&gt;     sample sizes can now be explicitly specified via the ni argument
#&gt;     when using the rma.uni() function (i.e., when measure="GEN"); the
#&gt;     escalc() function also now adds information on the ni values to the
#&gt;     resulting data frame (as an attribute of the yi variable), so, if
#&gt;     possible, this information is passed on to regtest.rma()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added switch so that regtest() can also provide the full results
#&gt;     from the fitted model (thanks to Michael Dewey for the suggestion)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - weights.rma.mh() now shows the weights in % as intended (thanks to
#&gt;     Gavin Stewart for pointing out this error)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - more flexible handling of the digits argument in the various forest
#&gt;     functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest functions now use pretty() by default to set the x-axis tick
#&gt;     locations (alim and at arguments can still be used for complete
#&gt;     control)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - studies that are considered to be 'influential' are now marked with
#&gt;     an asterisk when printing the results returned by the
#&gt;     influence.rma.uni() function (see the documentation of this function
#&gt;     for details on how such studies are identified)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added additional extractor functions for some of the influence
#&gt;     measures (i.e., cooks.distance(), dfbetas()); unfortunately, the
#&gt;     covratio() and dffits() functions in the stats package are not
#&gt;     generic; so, to avoid masking, there are currently no extractor
#&gt;     functions for these measures
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - better handling of missing values in some unusual situations
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - corrected small bug in fsn() that would not allow the user to
#&gt;     specify the standard errors instead of the sampling variances
#&gt;     (thanks to Bernd Weiss for pointing this out)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - plot.infl.rma.uni() function now allows the user to specify which
#&gt;     plots to draw (and the layout) and adds the option to show study
#&gt;     labels on the x-axis
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added proper print() method for objects generated by the
#&gt;     confint.rma.uni(), confint.rma.mh(), and confint.rma.peto()
#&gt;     functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - when transf or atransf argument was a monotonically decreasing
#&gt;     function, then confidence and prediction interval bounds were in
#&gt;     reversed order; various functions now check for this and order the
#&gt;     bounds correctly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - trimfill.rma.uni() now only prints information about the number of
#&gt;     imputed studies when actually printing the model object
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - qqnorm.rma.uni(), qqnorm.rma.mh(), and qqnorm.rma.peto() functions
#&gt;     now have a new argument called label, which allows for labeling of
#&gt;     points; the functions also now return (invisibly) the x and y
#&gt;     coordinates of the points drawn
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - rma.mh() with measure="RD" now computes the standard error of the
#&gt;     estimated risk difference based on Sato, Greenland, &amp; Robins (1989),
#&gt;     which provides a consistent estimate under both large-stratum and
#&gt;     sparse-data limiting models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now calculated using the
#&gt;     full likelihood equation (without leaving out additive constants)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the model deviance is now calculated as -2 times the difference
#&gt;     between the model log-likelihood and the log-likelihood under the
#&gt;     saturated model (this is a more appropriate definition of the
#&gt;     deviance than just taking -2 times the model log-likelihood)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - naming scheme of illustrative datasets bundled with the package has
#&gt;     been changed; now datasets are called &lt;dat.authoryear&gt;; therefore,
#&gt;     the datasets are now called (old name -&gt; new name):
#&gt;     
#&gt;       - dat.bcg -&gt; dat.colditz1994
#&gt;       - dat.warfarin -&gt; dat.hart1999
#&gt;       - dat.los -&gt; dat.normand1999
#&gt;       - dat.co2 -&gt; dat.curtis1998
#&gt;       - dat.empint -&gt; dat.mcdaniel1994
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - but dat.bcg has been kept as an alias for dat.colditz1994, as it has
#&gt;     been referenced under that name in some publications
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new dataset (dat.pritz1997) to illustrate the meta-analysis of
#&gt;     proportions (raw values and transformations thereof)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new dataset (dat.bonett2010) to illustrate the meta-analysis
#&gt;     of Cronbach's alpha values (raw values and transformations thereof)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new datasets (dat.hackshaw1998, dat.raudenbush1985)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - (approximate) standard error of the tau^2 estimate is now computed
#&gt;     and shown for most of the (residual) heterogeneity estimators
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added nobs() and df.residual() methods for objects of class rma
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - metafor.news() is now simply a wrapper for news(package="metafor")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the package code is now byte-compiled, which yields some modest
#&gt;     increases in execution speed
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some general code cleanup
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the metafor package no longer depends on the nlme package
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.6-0 (2011-04-13)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - trimfill.rma.uni() now returns a proper object even when the number
#&gt;     of missing studies is estimated to be zero
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the (log transformed) ratio of means as a possible outcome
#&gt;     measure to the escalc() and rma.uni() functions (measure="ROM")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new dataset (dat.co2) to illustrate the use of the ratio of
#&gt;     means outcome measure
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some additional error checking in the various forest functions
#&gt;     (especially when using the ilab argument)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in labbe.rma(), the solid and dashed lines are now drawn behind (and
#&gt;     not on top of) the points
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight change to transf.ipft.hm() so that missing values in targs$ni
#&gt;     are ignored
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.5-0 (2010-12-16)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the metafor package now has its own project website at:
#&gt;     http://www.metafor-project.org/
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added labbe() function to create L'Abbe plots
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the forest.default() and addpoly.default() functions now allow the
#&gt;     user to directly specify the lower and upper confidence interval
#&gt;     bounds (this can be useful when the CI bounds have been calculated
#&gt;     with other methods/functions)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the incidence rate for a single group and for two groups (and
#&gt;     transformations thereof) as possible outcome measures to the
#&gt;     escalc() and rma.uni() functions (measure="IRR", "IRD", "IRSD",
#&gt;     "IR", "IRLN", "IRS", and "IRFT")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the incidence rate ratio as a possible outcome measure to the
#&gt;     rma.mh() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added transformation functions related to incidence rates
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and its
#&gt;     inverse to the transformation functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added some additional error checking for out-of-range p-values in
#&gt;     the permutest.rma.uni() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added some additional checking for out-of-range values in several
#&gt;     transformation functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added confint() methods for rma.mh and rma.peto objects (only for
#&gt;     completeness sake; print already provides CIs)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added new datasets (dat.warfarin, dat.los, dat.empint)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.4-0 (2010-07-30)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - a paper about the package has now been published in the Journal of
#&gt;     Statistical Software (https://www.jstatsoft.org/v36/i03/)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added citation info; see: citation("metafor")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the metafor package now depends on the nlme package
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added extractor functions for the AIC, BIC, and deviance
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some updates to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.3-0 (2010-06-25)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the metafor package now depends on the Formula package
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - made escalc() generic and implemented a default and a formula
#&gt;     interface
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the (inverse) arcsine transformation to the set of
#&gt;     transformation functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.2-0 (2010-05-18)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cases where k is very small (e.g., k equal to 1 or 2) are now
#&gt;     handled more gracefully
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added sanity check for cases where all observed outcomes are equal
#&gt;     to each other (this led to division by zero when using the Knapp &amp;
#&gt;     Hartung method)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the "smarter way to set the number of iterations for permutation
#&gt;     tests" (see notes for previous version below) now actually works
#&gt;     like it is supposed to
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - the permutest.rma.uni() function now provides more sensible results
#&gt;     when k is very small; the documentation for the function has also
#&gt;     been updated with some notes about the use of permutation tests
#&gt;     under those circumstances
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - made some general improvements to the various forest plot functions
#&gt;     making them more flexible in particular when creating more complex
#&gt;     displays; most importantly, added a rows argument and removed the
#&gt;     addrows argument
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some additional examples have been added to the help files for the
#&gt;     forest and addpoly functions to demonstrate how to create more
#&gt;     complex displays with these functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added showweight argument to the forest.default() and forest.rma()
#&gt;     functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cumul() functions not showing all of the output columns when using
#&gt;     fixed-effects models has been corrected
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - weights.rma.uni() function now handles NAs appropriately
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - weights.rma.mh() and weights.rma.peto() functions added
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - logLik.rma() function now behaves more like other logLik() functions
#&gt;     (such as logLik.lm() and logLik.lme())
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.1-0 (2010-04-28)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - cint() generic removed and replaced with confint() method for
#&gt;     objects of class rma.uni
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slightly improved the code to set the x-axis title in the forest()
#&gt;     and funnel() functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added coef() method for permutest.rma.uni objects
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added append argument to escalc() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - implemented a smarter way to set the number of iterations for
#&gt;     permutation tests (i.e., the permutest.rma.uni() function will now
#&gt;     switch to an exact test if the number of iterations required for an
#&gt;     exact test is actually smaller than the requested number of
#&gt;     iterations for an approximate test)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - changed the way how p-values for individual coefficients are
#&gt;     calculated in permutest.rma.uni() to 'two times the one-tailed area
#&gt;     under the permutation distribution' (more consistent with the way we
#&gt;     typically define two-tailed p-values)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added retpermdist argument to permutest.rma.uni() to return the
#&gt;     permutation distributions of the test statistics
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight improvements to the various transformation functions to cope
#&gt;     better with some extreme cases
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - p-values are now calculated in such a way that very small p-values
#&gt;     stored in fitted model objects are no longer truncated to 0 (the
#&gt;     printed results are still truncated depending on the number of
#&gt;     digits specified)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - changed the default number of iterations for the ML, REML, and EB
#&gt;     estimators from 50 to 100
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 1.0-1 (2010-02-02)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - version jump in conjunction with the upcoming publication of a paper
#&gt;     in the Journal of Statistical Software describing the metafor
#&gt;     package
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - instead of specifying a model matrix, the user can now specify a
#&gt;     model formula for the mods argument in the rma() function (e.g.,
#&gt;     like in the lm() function)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - permutest() function now allows exact permutation tests (but this is
#&gt;     only feasible when k is not too large)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest() function now uses the level argument properly to adjust the
#&gt;     CI level of the summary estimate for models without moderators
#&gt;     (i.e., for fixed- and random-effets models)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest() function can now also show the prediction interval as a
#&gt;     dashed line for a random-effects model
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - information about the measure used is now passed on to the forest()
#&gt;     and funnel() functions, which try to set an appropriate x-axis title
#&gt;     accordingly
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - funnel() function now has more arguments (e.g., atransf, at)
#&gt;     providing more control over the display of the x-axis
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - predict() function now has its own print() method and has a new
#&gt;     argument called addx, which adds the values of the moderator
#&gt;     variables to the returned object (when addx=TRUE)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - functions now properly handle the na.action "na.pass" (treated
#&gt;     essentially like "na.exclude")
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added method for weights() to extract the weights used when fitting
#&gt;     models with rma.uni()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some small improvements to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-7 (2009-12-06)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added permutest() function for permutation tests
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added metafor.news() function to display the NEWS file of the
#&gt;     metafor package within R (based on same idea in the animate package
#&gt;     by Yihui Xie)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added some checks for values below machine precision
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - a bit of code reorganization (nothing that affects how the functions
#&gt;     work)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-6 (2009-10-19)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - small changes to the computation of the DFFITS and DFBETAS values in
#&gt;     the influence() function, so that these statistics are more in line
#&gt;     with their definitions in regular linear regression models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added option to the plot function for objects returned by
#&gt;     influence() to allow plotting the covariance ratios on a log scale
#&gt;     (now the default)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - slight adjustments to various print() functions (to catch some
#&gt;     errors when certain values were NA)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a control option to rma() to adjust the step length of the
#&gt;     Fisher scoring algorithm by a constant factor (this may be useful
#&gt;     when the algorithm does not converge)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-5 (2009-10-08)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the phi coefficient (measure="PHI"), Yule's Q ("YUQ"), and
#&gt;     Yule's Y ("YUY") as additional measures to the escalc() function
#&gt;     for 2x2 table data
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - forest plots now order the studies so that the first study is at the
#&gt;     top of the plot and the last study at the bottom (the order can
#&gt;     still be set with the order or subset argument)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added cumul() function for cumulative meta-analyses (with a
#&gt;     corresponding forest() method to plot the cumulative results)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added leave1out() function for leave-one-out diagnostics
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added option to qqnorm.rma.uni() so that the user can choose whether
#&gt;     to apply the Bonferroni correction to the bounds of the pseudo
#&gt;     confidence envelope
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some internal changes to the class and methods names
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some small corrections to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-4 (2009-09-18)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - corrected the trimfill() function
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - improvements to various print functions
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added a regtest() function for various regression tests of funnel
#&gt;     plot asymmetry (e.g., Egger's regression test)
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - made ranktest() generic and added a method for objects of class rma
#&gt;     so that the test can be carried out after fitting
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added anova() function for full vs reduced model comparisons via fit
#&gt;     statistics and likelihood ratio tests
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the Orwin and Rosenberg approaches to fsn()
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added H^2 measure to the output for random-effects models
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - in escalc(), measure="COR" is now used for the (usual) raw
#&gt;     correlation coefficient and measure="UCOR" for the bias corrected
#&gt;     correlation coefficients
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - some small corrections to the documentation
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-3 (2009-07-31)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - small changes to some of the examples
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added the log transformed proportion (measure="PLN") as another
#&gt;     measure to the escalc() function; changed "PL" to "PLO" for the
#&gt;     logit (i.e., log odds) transformation for proportions
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-2 (2009-07-06)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - added an option in plot.infl.rma.uni() to open a new device for
#&gt;     plotting the DFBETAS values
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - thanks to Jim Lemon, added a much better method for adjusting the
#&gt;     size of the labels, annotations, and symbols in the forest()
#&gt;     function when the number of studies is large
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-1 (2009-06-14)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - made some small changes to the documentation (some typos corrected,
#&gt;     some confusing points clarified)
#&gt; 
#&gt;                  Changes in version 0.5-0 (2009-06-05)                  
#&gt; 
#&gt;   - first version released on CRAN</div></pre>
